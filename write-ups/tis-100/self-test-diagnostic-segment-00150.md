# ‚ÄúSelf-Test Diagnostic‚Äù (Segment 00150)

### Tasks <a href="#tasks" id="tasks"></a>

For the first challenge _‚ÄúSelf-Test Diagnostic‚Äù (Segment 00150)_ we need to complete the following task:

* Read a value from **IN.X** and write the value to **OUT.X**.
* Read a value from **IN.A** and write the value to **OUT.A**.

### Solution <a href="#solution" id="solution"></a>

This challenge will help you understand how to transfer input data from one node to another. _IN.X_ sends data to node #1 and needs to be transfered to _OUT.X_ below node #9. _IN.A_ sends data to node #4 and needs to be transfered to _OUT.A_ below node #12. To solve for _Ouput.X_, we need to `MOV` the data being inputed from _IN.X_ which is above node #1 `UP` and move it `DOWN` to node #5 and so on and so forth. The sequence of commands to transfer _IN.X_ to _OUT.X_ is:

```
MOV UP, DOWN #N1
MOV UP, DOWN #N5
MOV UP, DOWN #N9
```

To solve for Ouput.A we have to work around node #8 since there is a communcation failure and can not be accessed. The sequence of commands to solve for OUT.A are:

```
MOV UP, LEFT    #N4
MOV RIGHT, DOWN #N3
MOV UP, DOWN    #N7
MOV UP, RIGHT   #N11
MOV LEFT, DOWN  #N12
```

After completing the following sequences, you can now press _F5_ to run and solve the program!
