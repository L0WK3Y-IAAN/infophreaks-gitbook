# ‚ÄúSignal Amplifier‚Äù (Segment 10981)

### Tasks <a href="#tasks" id="tasks"></a>

For the second challenge _‚ÄúSignal Amplifier‚Äù_ _(Segment 10981)_ we need to complete the following tasks:

* Read a value from **IN.A**.
* Double the value.
* Write the value to **OUT.A**.

In the _‚ÄúSignal Amplifier‚Äù_ challenge, we are introduced to the `ADD` instruction and the `ACC` register. As you can see in the image above the output is expecting the value to be double that of the input. We can start by moving the value from _IN.A_ to the _ACC_ register in node #2. After moving the input value to _ACC_ we want to double the value, we can do this by adding the value stored in the _ACC_ register to itself. Once the value is doubled we can then transfer that value to the output. The sequence of commands to solve for _OUT.A_ are:

```
MOV UP, ACC     #N2
ADD ACC         #N2
MOV ACC, DOWN   #N2
MOV UP, DOWN    #N6
MOV UP, RIGHT   #N10
MOV LEFT, DOWN  #N11
```

After completing the following sequences, you can now press _F5_ to run and solve the program!
